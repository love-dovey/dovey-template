Template game for [dövey2d](https://github.com/pisayesiwsi/dovey2d), a small extension for LÖVE2D made for personal projects.

this project's is meant to be repurposed for games and/or programs using dövey2d alongside LÖVE, if you wanna have more control however, it is recommended for you to either modify your own instance of dövey, or if you believe your feature should be in dövey by default, **[make a pull request](https://github.com/pisayesiwsi/dovey2d/pulls)** as it is much appreciated.

this game template is just as work in progress as the rest of the engine, so expect it to not contain many of the features you may want to see working out, though, you're welcome to **[open an issue](https://github.com/pisayesiwsi/dovey-template/issues)** at anytime.

to clone this repository, make sure to append `--recurse-submodules` as it is important to have them so the game can launch in the first place.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pisayesiwsi/dovey-template.git
```
though if you prefer using SSH verification, change the link to `git@github.com:pisayesiwsi/dovey-template.git`
